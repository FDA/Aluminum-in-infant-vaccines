Safety Assessment Algorithm for Aluminum in Infant Vaccines
This algorithm was originally developed at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to assist in safety prediction of aluminum containing infant vaccines.  A full description of the algorithm is published in the journal “vaccine” (Mitkus et al. 2011). The algorithm is capable of creating aluminum pharmacokinetic profiles for infant following recommended vaccination schedule by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Also it predicts aluminum safety threshold based on the level set by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 
Getting Started
To run the algorithm, you'll need the following items:
•	Read the Mitkus et al. 2011 (Vaccine 29: 9538-9543)
•	Install R (tested for version >3.0)
•	Install the R package (“deSolve”)
